Package `github.com/prog-1/list` is implemented as a separate subpackage.
Go provides an easy way of working with multiple packages. Reed more about it
at https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/workspaces. You may also want to read
https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-file-replace to check on how do we allow
two package to co-exist together.

1. Implement missing `list.List` methods and tests.
2. Implement `InsertionSort` and `InsertSorted` functions and tests. While implementing
   the functions, it is not allowed to add any extra helpers to `list.List`. You
   must use only the methods exported by `list.List` and `list.Element`.
